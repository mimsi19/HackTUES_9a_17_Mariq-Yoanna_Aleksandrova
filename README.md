DONE

Love Me
Jane XÃ˜

You pull me in to the edge of your lips
Till you know that I'm falling
Won't you give something more than a kiss
Make it last till the morning
I can't take it when you give me just enough to
Keep me waiting
I'll be wanting you more
I know
I never tell you no
I never tell you no
Just know
Love me or let me go
Love me or let me go
I know
I never tell you no
I never tell you no
You're all I want
So love me or let me go
Love me or let me go
Love me or let me go
Hold my breath when you're gone
I'm a mess when you're not there to hold me
I confess I don't mean to obsess
But it's your touch that owns me
I can't take it when you give me just enough to
Keep me waiting
I'll be wanting you more
I know
I never tell you no
I never tell you no
Just know
Love me or let me go
Love me or let me go
I know
I never tell you no
I never tell you no
You're all I want
So love me or let me go
Love me or let me go
Love me or let me go
So love me or let me go
Love me or let me go
Love me or let me go
